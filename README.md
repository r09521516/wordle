# React Wordle App

Try to guess a five-letter word and find the final answer.

Enter or delete letters until you have five, then press Enter to check your attempt.

Result of attempts:
- Gray means the letter is not in the final answer.
- Green means the letter is in the correct position.
- Orange means the letter is in the word but not in the correct position.

Guide:
- "TIMES" displays the number of attempts you've made.
- "NEW GAME" starts a new round.
- "ANSWER" reveals the correct word.
